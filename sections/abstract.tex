\begin{abstract}
Quantum technology has major implications for information security, both in terms of code-breaking and -making, and the strategic interplay between the two. However these implications are far more nuanced than is often captured in the popular press. Here we provide a broad overview of different aspects of information security in the quantum era, examining the security implications of quantum technology and important long-term strategic considerations. This work is written at a non-expert level, providing an accessible overview where the limited amount of mathematics employed can safely be glossed over by the non-expert.
