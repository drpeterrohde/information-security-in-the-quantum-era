\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

The interplay between information security and quantum technology is both a fascinating and highly non-trivial one that extends far beyond code-breaking and -making. Despite large-scale quantum computing being a long-term objective, the implications are highly relevant today, albeit with many nuances and caveats. Although the technological trajectory is hard to predict, the long term strategic importance of understanding this interplay is already clear and with or without this technology at hand it is essential to keep these implications in mind in any present-day considerations of information security.
